## How to write Test Cases

## How to run Tests
All the test triggering is done through maven commands, this framework supports multiple different types of 
tests execution such as smoke, regression, and end-to-end on different possible environment such as QA, Staging
and UAT. 
### Executing specific tests
If you would like to execute a specific test stated on testng.xml file
```shell script
mvn test -Dtestof="smoke_api"
```

If you would like to execute all the tests that are stated on testng.xml file
```shell script
mvn test
```

If you would like to execute multiple different types of tests stated on testng.xml file
```shell script
mvn test -Dtestof="test1", "test2", "test3"
```

If you would like to execute a specific test on specific environment ( default=UAT )
```shell script
mvn test -Dtestof="test1" -Denv="Staging"
```
